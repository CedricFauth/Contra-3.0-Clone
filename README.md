# Contra-3.0-Clone

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CedricFauth/Contra-3.0-Clone.git
```

After cloning you can open the Project via `Unity HUB Projects` -> `Open`. On first start you need to select the right Scene because a new Scene is created by default. Otherwise you won't see any Objects.

`File` -> `Open Scene` -> `Levels/Level 1.unity`
